# PHP contact form

by Cheung Kin Wong

## Mission

Your client would like you to make him a website with a few pages. One of the pages should actually contain a contact form, so that people can send him messages.

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

-    [x] When one submits the form, you receive an email with the form content to my email address
-    [x] Most PHP code is above the html doctype line
-    [x] All PHP variable names are explicit and consistently named
-    [x] PHP contents as little comments as possible, but as much as necessary
-    [x] DRY: repeated instructions are wrapped into custom PHP functions
-    [x] If one forgets the email address or the message, the proper feedback message is displayed and no email is sent
-    [x] If one enters an incorrectly formatted email message, the proper feedback message is displayed and no email is sent
-    [ ] If there are more than one error, all error messages are displayed in one html (un)ordered list (above the first question in the form).
-    [x] If one enters some javascript code in any input field, the javascript is removed
-    [x] The HTML is valid html5, as per the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
-    [x] The HTML is accessible, as per the [Web Accessiblity Checker](https://achecker.ca/checker/) online tool.
-    [x] The Git Repository Readme file is useful (what / why / when / who / where)
